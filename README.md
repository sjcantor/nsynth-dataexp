# nsynth-dataexp
Current progress:  
- `download_data.sh` downloads NSynth test data (only because it's smaller than train, we should use train to future data analysis) to `datasets/nsynth-test`
- `nsynth-exploration.ipynb` contains simple query for audio files/metadata for an instrument + quality combo
